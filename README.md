## Software OpenGL for WatcomC++

Just link GLIMPL.CPP and include GL.H to your WatcomC++ project.  

For some fun: link _YELLOW.CPP to see "Yellow Rose of Texas" a 4k by Fit and Bandwagon.  

This OpenGL "Emulation" is purely in software "slow" and not optimized yet.  

A demo game can be found here: https://github.com/kosmonautdnb/OpenGLDemoGame_DOS  

This is part of my "template lib" here: https://github.com/kosmonautdnb/TemplateLib_WatcomC.git
