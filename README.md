## Software OpenGL for DOS/WatcomC++

Just include and link  
  GL.H  
  GLIMPL.CPP  
to your WatcomC++ project.  

For some fun: link _YELLOW.CPP to see "Yellow Rose of Texas" a 4k by Fit and Bandwagon.  

A demo game can be found here: https://github.com/kosmonautdnb/OpenGLDemoGame_DOS  

This is part of my "template lib" here: https://github.com/kosmonautdnb/TemplateLib_WatcomC.git
