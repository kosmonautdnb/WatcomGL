## Software OpenGL for DOS/WatcomC++

Just include and link:  
  GL.H  
  GLIMPL.CPP  
in your WatcomC++ project.  

For some fun: link _YELLOW.CPP to see "Yellow Rose of Texas" a 4k by Fit and Bandwagon.  

A demo game can be found here: https://github.com/kosmonautdnb/OpenGLDemoGame_DOS  

This is part of my "template lib" here: https://github.com/kosmonautdnb/TemplateLib_WatcomC.git  

If you use DJGPP instead of WatcomC++ on DOS maybe this is an additional software OpenGL option:  
https://github.com/EMGD-Community/mesa/blob/master/docs/README.DJ  
DJGPP was removed from support as of Mesa6.5.3, though. Current Mesa Version is: 25.1.6..
